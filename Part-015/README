What you will learn:

Creating Single Page Applications with ojModule and oj.router

How to use this sample:

1. Open the sample.

2. Talk about adding 'header' and 'footer' modules and loading them in index.html:

<header data-bind="ojModule: {name:'header'}"></header>

<footer data-bind="ojModule: {name:'footer'}"></footer>

3. Look again at the index.html file and point out that a router handles loading of modules.

Look at the two 'home' and 'people'. 

In index.html, add router configuration between the header and footer:

<div data-bind="ojModule: { name: router.stateId()}"></div>

Open main.js, talk about the code defining the router in the 'require' block.

4. Add navigation component.

Talk about needing an Oracle JET component to let the user control the router.

Open 'header.js' and 'header.html' and talk about the ojNavigationList component.
