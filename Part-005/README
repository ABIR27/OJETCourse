What you will learn:

Component-based development with Knockout.js.

How to use this sample:

1. Discuss the problem that Knockout components solve.
2. In the code, look at Knockout.js component created in app.js, with its view in app.js.
3. Notice the usage of js/viewModels, an idea to prepare the way for Oracle JET.
4. In index file, usage of "component" binding to load the Knockout component.
5. Point out that Oracle JET also has components, expressed in JQuery UI, which we will see later.
