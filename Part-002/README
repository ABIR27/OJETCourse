How to use this sample:

1. Inclusion of 'require.js' via 'bower.json' file.
2. Look at index file and notice that JavaScript files are not loaded there.
3. Instead, require.js is loaded in index file, with 'data-main' pointing to entry point.
4. Look at 'main.js' (which has a 'require' block). Each application only has one 'require' block.
5. Look at 'buyer.js', which has a 'define' block. Each module is a 'define' block.
