What you will learn:

Separating the HTML view from the JavaScript business logic.

How to use this sample:

1. Point out that separating the view from the business logic has advantages.
2. Note the inclusion of requirejs-text.
3. Note the Knockout.js component created in app.js, with its view in app.html.
4. Usage of js/viewModels and js/Views, to prepare for Oracle JET.
5. In index file, usage of "component" binding to load the Knockout component.
6. Point out that we will see this same pattern in Oracle JET applications.
