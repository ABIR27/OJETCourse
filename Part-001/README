What you will learn:

A fundamental problem in JavaScript is that (1) you need to specify
the load order of JavaScript files and (2) you have no control over
when a JavaScript file is loaded.

How to use this sample:

1. Run the application.
2. The Console (Output window Ctrl-4 in NetBeans) shows the output.
3. Go to the index file and change the load order of the two JavaScript files.
4. Point out that the application doesn't work anymore because of load order problems.
5. Explain that we can delegate the load order to 'require.js' in part 002.
6. Explain that this is one of several problems in larger JavaScript applications, e.g.,
   data visualization, accesibility, internationalization -- and that these are
   low-level infrastructural problems that we shouldn't need to think about.
