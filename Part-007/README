What you will learn:

First usage of Oracle JET, instead of Require.js and Knockout.js separately.

How to use this sample:

1. Remove Require.js and Knockout.js from bower.json.
2. Include dependency on "oraclejet": "2.0.1" instead.
3. Compare the result to the previous example.
4. The application should work exactly as before.
